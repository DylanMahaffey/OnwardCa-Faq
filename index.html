                    <p class="faq_card-answer">
                        Onward is an initiative aiming to connect displaced workers across the country to essential services and careers in
                        their area. This initiative was created in direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and is projected to help millions
                        of displaced workers get back on their feet as quickly as possible, jumpstarting economic recovery in the process.
                        <br><br>
                        You can think of Onward as a branch of Bitwise, but this is a huge initiative powered through partnerships with many
                        different organizations.

                        In this situation, you are an Independent Contractor. Bitwise is your customer, hiring you for your services (Data

                        hours through our system.

                    <p class="faq_card-answer">
                        Step 1: Submit your W-9 form

                            <li>
                                You’ll do this through an online form sent to you by our team, so that our accountants can easily and quickly input your
                                data into our system.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After submitting this form, you’ll receive a unique ID number that you will need to put on your invoices.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Step 2: Set up your account on Bill.com
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Our team will send you a link to do this.

                            <li>
                                Once you set up your account on Bill.com, you will not need to access it again, as we will <span class="highlight-blue">not be invoicing through

                    <p class="faq_card-answer">
                        If you’re new to the world of being an Independent Contractor, it can be confusing. Here’s some information to help
                        clarify some things:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                As an Independent Contractor offering your Data Entry services, you are your own Company, and you’re the Company Owner
                                as well. <span class="highlight-blue">Company’s Name</span> will be <span class="highlight-blue">your name</span> and <span class="highlight-blue">Company Owner’s SSN</span> will be <span class="highlight-blue">your SSN</span>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Our accounting team doesn’t need you to fill out the fields <span class="highlight-blue">Business Type, Industry, and Accounting Service</span> <i>but</i> Bill.com
                                requires them for your profile. So it doesn’t matter too much, but we recommend the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><span class="highlight-blue"> Business Type:</span> Individual </li>
                                    <li><span class="highlight-blue"> Industry:</span> General Service </li>

                        </ol>

                    <p class="faq_card-answer">
                        If you already have an account set up with Bill.com for past work, please make sure your billing information is up to
                        date. Then, you’ll need to access the link sent to you by our leadership team so that Bitwise is linked to your account
                        as a customer.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="highlight-blue">Important Note:</span> You will not invoice us through Bill.com, even if that’s what you’re used to. You will use the online

                    <p class="faq_card-answer">
                        Our team will send you a secure online invoice form and remind you when it’s time to submit it. Remember to save the
                        unique ID number you received after submitting your W-9, as this will need to be entered on all invoices.
                        <br><br>
                        You’ll keep track of your hours worked on your own, on whatever platform works for you. Remember to communicate to your
                        leadership team which time of day you’ll be working, so they can easily cross-check your hours on our software if
                        needed.

                    <p class="faq_card-answer">
                        Your leadership team takes on this responsibility, and they’ll be checking to see if your hours invoiced realistically
                        line up with your work completed and time spent on our system. If any issues concerning this arise, they will be
                        reaching out to you for clarity.
                        <br><br>
                        It’s important to communicate to your Resource Coordinator which hours you’ll be working, so that these cross-checks go
                        smoothly when needed and there’s no hold put on your invoice.

                        We will be on an every-other-week pay schedule, and your leadership team will remind you when it’s time to send in your
                        invoice for each pay period.

                        <span class="highlight-blue">Tip:</span> As an Independent Contractor, you are strongly encouraged to save 25-30% of each paycheck, to go towards your taxes
                        at the end of the year. First-time Independent Contractors who don’t know this often run into trouble when it comes time
                        to pay taxes, because they find themselves financially unprepared.
